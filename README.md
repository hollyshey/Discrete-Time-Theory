# ⏱️ Discrete-Time Theory Library

**Discrete-Time Theory** is a comprehensive toolkit for modeling, analyzing, and simulating discrete-time signals and systems.  
It covers difference equations, convolution, z-transforms, stability analysis, and digital filter design.

This library can serve both as an educational reference and a practical engine for DSP, control systems, and time-series applications.

- 🔄 **Difference Equations**  
  Define and solve linear constant-coefficient difference equations.

- 📊 **Convolution & Correlation**  
  Fast implementations of discrete convolution and auto/cross‐correlation.

- 🧠 **Z-Transform**  
  Compute forward and inverse z-transforms, pole-zero plots, and region-of-convergence.

- 🎚️ **Digital Filter Design**  
  Design and analyze FIR and IIR filters; compute frequency responses and stability checks.

- 📦 **Modular API**  
  Well-structured modules for signals, systems, transforms, and utilities.

- 🛠️ **CLI & Examples**  
  Command-line demos for typical workflows and Jupyter notebooks with illustrative examples.
